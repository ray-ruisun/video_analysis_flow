# Videos Directory

Place your 3 human-verified video files here.

## Requirements

- **3 videos** verified as human-created content (e.g., via Deepware)
- Recommended naming: `v1.mp4`, `v2.mp4`, `v3.mp4`
- Videos should be from the same creator/channel for meaningful style consensus
- Common formats supported: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`

## Example Structure

```
videos/
├── v1.mp4
├── v2.mp4
└── v3.mp4
```

## Compliance

- Use only **human-created** videos
- No portrait/face analysis will be performed
- Ensure you have proper rights to analyze the content
- Recommended: cooking tutorials, product reviews, educational content

## Notes

- Larger videos will be automatically downsampled for efficiency
- Frame extraction is non-destructive (original files unchanged)
- For best audio analysis, ensure videos have audio tracks
